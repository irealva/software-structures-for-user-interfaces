Assignment 1: Web Lab for SUI
=============================

In this assignment, I've implemented a 4x4 sliding puzzle using React, Webpack and flexbox. The bells and whistles I've implemented are:

- The ability to move by using the keyboard
- Some layout and UI improvements

It took me around 6 hours.

## To run

Simply use any server (i.e. python or live-serve) in the main directly. That should load A1.html as the main html file which calls on bundle.js as the main javascript file.

To create a new bundle.js run `webpack`.

## To run dev environment

First `npm install`

Then run `webpack-dev-server`.
