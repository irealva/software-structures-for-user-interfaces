# Problems

I did have some trouble loading images efficiently without having to write more spaghetti code. For the container test, in my current implementation, by the time an image loads, the context has translated to another place so the first image is drawn outside of the canvas. 

# Doodle Submission

My submissions for part 2, the doodle can be found at 'doodle.js'. It creates a random doodle each time it is loaded, so I included more than one example in the './doodles/' folder

# References

I referred to the following pages for example code for: a) calculating the coordinates around the edge of a circle and b) generating a random number
