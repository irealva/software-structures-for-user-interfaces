SUI Assignment 3 :: State Machines
===

## Implementation

The game should work as expected.

## My own state machine game version

For my own version "statemachine_own.html" I created a set of blue balloons that change position at random every 3 seconds. They can be exploded like normal balloons but will keep moving throughout the game.

## Resources used

Used this resource to get an idea for how to find the area where two rectangles intersect:
